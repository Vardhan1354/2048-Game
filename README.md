🎮 Project Highlight: Console-Based 2048 Game in C

As part of my self-learning journey in system-level programming, I built a 2048 Game using the C language for the Windows console.
This project was a deep dive into low-level programming concepts like memory, pointers, and console handling — far beyond simple script-level development.

💡 Why I Built This:
The goal was to understand how classic games are implemented from scratch without any game engine. I challenged myself to work with raw input handling, custom color schemes, and board logic — all within a terminal window.

🛠️ What I Built:
• Fully playable 2048 logic using a 4×4 matrix
• Intuitive controls with W, A, S, D and arrow keys
• Color-coded tiles using Windows Console API
• Implemented tile merging, movement, scoring, and game-over logic
• Multiple color schemes: original, blue-red, and black-white
• Built-in unit testing system for logic validation
• Smooth animations and keyboard input handling with _getch() and Sleep()

🧠 Key Learnings:
✔️ Hands-on with low-level Windows API functions
✔️ Applied bitwise operations, input handling, and control flow
✔️ Designed a clear modular structure for logic, display, and color schemes
✔️ Developed and passed custom unit tests for array manipulation
✔️ Gained experience building an interactive project without external libraries

🎓 Project Type: Self-Driven System-Level Game (C Programming)
📅 Developed in: March 2025

💬 Would love feedback from C programmers and game developers on how to make this more efficient or portable!
